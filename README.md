#### A simple approach to dealing with multiple implementations of the same interface

---

## Overview

This project explores a simple approach to managing dependency injection by leveraging delegates, offering a flexible solution for handling various implementations of the same interface.

The delegate used in this project is dynamically selected based on values provided in the headers of incoming requests. This enables a fine-grained approach to dependency injection, allowing different implementations to be chosen based on contextual information.
